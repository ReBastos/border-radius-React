# Border-Radius Previewer

> A simple way to mold complex shapes to your components, without needing to try a different value of broder-radius at each corner of it.

## How Does It Work

<img src='screenshots/screenshot1.png' width='500px'><br>
To create a complex shape, you only need to change the values in the range inputs at the right and see how the component box at the left shapes.<br>
To use the shape you made, you can click at the "copy" button, to copy the CSS code of the shape.
